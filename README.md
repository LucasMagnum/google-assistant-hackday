# HackDay Project - Google Assistant 
Hacking Google Assistant in 24 hours to respond to custom voice commmands.


# Learnings
- IFTTT is a good start but won't let you create a dynamic conversational experience with Google Assitant.
- Google Actions platform is the way to go if you to create a product out of it
- Controlling the Google Assistant UI it's harder than we thought
- Webhooks are good but it needs more structure to route the questions and give the right answers
